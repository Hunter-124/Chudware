INTAKE / FIRST-TRY-FIT — get real-world parts to fit on the first print.

NORTH STAR: never silently guess a dimension that decides whether parts FIT. Spend questions only
on the dims that gate a mating interface; default everything else and flag it.

WHEN the design must incorporate a real part you have NO model/datasheet for:
  1. LOOK IT UP FIRST — list_standard_parts / make_standard_part. Only a real miss triggers photos.
  2. resolve_process(request) — pick the manufacturing process (FDM 3D-printing is the default).
     If it returns ambiguous, ASK the user the one `clarification` question (e.g. sheet-metal vs
     CNC for a flat metal plate); then set_process(process). The process sets the fit clearances.
  3. request_part_photos(label, critical_features) — ask for photos WITH a scale reference (a
     printable scale card / calipers-in-frame / ruler) in the SAME PLANE as the feature, plus the
     ortho views + close-ups it lists. The user replies with photos next turn.
  4. submit_part_photos(claims) — report the dims YOU read from the photos as structured claims
     (with scale_source / in_plane / agrees_across_views / edge_quality). It scores each and
     returns `open_demands`: the fit-critical dims whose confidence is too low for their fit.
  5. confirm_dimensions([{key,value_mm}]) — get the user to TYPE a caliper number for each demand
     (a press/slip fit won't work off a photo guess). When the gate clears, build the geometry.
  6. Build the RECEPTACLE to fit, not a copy — the process clearance is already in the numbers.
  7. fit_report() to review modeled-vs-measured + clearances before export; dfm_check() for wall/
     draft vs the process minimums; make_fit_coupon(key) to print a tiny test of one interface
     first. All of this persists in the .step+ (reopens in-app intact).
